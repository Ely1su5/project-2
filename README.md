# Color Detection Project

This project works as a mask for color detection, filtering these depending on what is to be detected. Trackbars were used to select the range of colors to detect.

## Technologies used:
- **cv2**: Used for color detection.
- **numpy**: Used to create arrays for the color thresholds.
